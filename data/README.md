# data

## What are these files?
* `prbs`, `id1` and `id2`: contain the data of the identification trajectories (0, 1 and 2, respectively), and by data I mean the measured signals from the robot (joint position, velocity and torques)
* `fprbs`, `fid1` and `fid2`: contain the same as above, but filtered
* `theta_*`: contains the dynamic parameters obtained with a given trajectory, and the `_fr` is with friction modeled
* `srukf_plain_*`: contains the data generated by the SRUKF with the given trajectory as an input
* `t_w_f_*`: corresponds to `torque_with_force` and is the simulated signal with the force applied in one direction.
* `srukf_f_*`: is the data generated by the SRUKF with these simulated signals as an input
