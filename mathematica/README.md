## Programs
* `dynamics`: calculates the dynamic model of the robot
* `linearizing`: calculates the regressor from the dynamic model
* `ToMatlab`: is a script that translates the Wolfram Mathematica expression to a MATLAB one. Originally from [here](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/577/), but this is a bugfixed version, as described by kiara in [this stackexchange post](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/166178), found [here](https://pastebin.com/TcjErHVT)
