## Programs
* `matrixA`, `matrixB`, `matrixJ` and `regressor_fr` are the matrices of the forward and inverse dynamics, as well as the Jacobian, generated by the Wolfram Mathematica programs
* `sgn` is a function to return the sign (positive, negative or zero) of the argument
* `tight` removes unnecessary white space from plots and set a fixed size for the figure
* `linspecer` utility to generate colors for the plots. Credits to [Jonathan C. Lansey at Matlab File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42673-beautiful-and-distinguishable-line-colors-colormap)
* `distinguishable_colors` utility to generate colors for the plots. Credits to [Tim Holy at Matlab File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29702-generate-maximally-perceptually-distinct-colors)
